Feature: Cache Management
  As a system user
  I want to ensure proper cache management
  So that data is efficiently stored and retrieved

  Scenario: Cache warming on application startup
    Given the application is starting
    When cache warming is triggered
    Then all required caches should be populated
    And cache entries should be valid

  Scenario: Dynamic cache refresh
    Given a cache entry with TTL
    When the TTL expires
    Then the cache should be automatically refreshed
    And the new data should be valid

  Scenario: Cache invalidation
    Given a cache entry exists
    When the entry is invalidated
    Then subsequent requests should fetch fresh data

  Scenario: Cache hit/miss metrics
    Given the application is running
    When cache operations are performed
    Then metrics should be properly recorded
    And cache hit/miss ratios should be tracked

  Scenario: Cache configuration validation
    Given cache configuration is loaded
    Then all cache settings should be valid
    And cache timeouts should be within acceptable ranges
